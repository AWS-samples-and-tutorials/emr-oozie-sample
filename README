EMR-OOZIE-SAMPLE
----------------

simple example of Elastic Map Reduce bootstrap actions for configuring apache oozie.

To use
======

see the makefile.  pretty straightforward, there is a boostrap action bash
script that will install and configure the oozie software on the emr cluster.  
the script is in the config subdirectory, and the makefile shows how to use it
when launching a emr cluster.

Prerequisites
=============

you need the following:
  - make
  - emr commandline tools (seem below for html link)
  - s3cmd (see below)


to run
======

% make create

will create a new emr cluster the oozie installed using the bootstrap action
in config/config-oozie.sh

% make destroy

will terminate the emr cluster 

% make ssh

this will ssh into the head node of the cluster.

to use oozie
============

the oozie software is installed in /opt/oozie...

the oozie-server, a web-based console, is running on port 11000.  once you create the cluster, you can set up a
ssh tunnel (using % make sshproxy) then open a web browser to http://localhost:11000.  

To submit a job, you can use the commandline oozie tool in /opt/oozie.../bin/ozzie

for example, 
oozie@ip-10-145-160-115:/opt/oozie-3.1.3-incubating$ ./bin/oozie job  -oozie http://localhost:11000/oozie -config  ./examples/apps/map-reduce/job.properties -run run

to do this, you have to push the examples into local hdfs, and configure the job.properties as follows:
nameNode=hdfs://localhost:9000
jobTracker=localhost:9100
queueName=default
examplesRoot=examples

(you can find the details of the hadoop configuration in /home/hadoop/conf).
